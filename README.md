# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

I was motivated to build this project to improve my skills with HTML and CSS, as well as jQuery + working with third party APIs. Using the Day.js library, I developed a daily planner for 9-5 work schedules. 

## Installation

Go to my git page to deploy link and test. 

## Usage

Once on the git page, you can add and save any to-do items for the day. 

## Credits

Shout out to UofM with the starter code, and Charlie, my tutor, for the help.
